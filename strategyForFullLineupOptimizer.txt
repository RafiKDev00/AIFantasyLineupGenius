B"SD

Basic Outline:

  1. Get full team âˆš
  2. Extract all players values - we need an algorithm that can optimze the amount of points
    - tricky because some players can be in mulitple positions
    - we want to do all the optimizing "in abstract", don't post untill the end
  3. Return and post all individual
  4. set up a server to do this on a timer
    - Also have it email me if there are any issues with logging in.

  5. Bonus scrape from some advanced fantasy projections and use those/compare them to ESPN to make judgements
  6. Trade Handling


Optimization Logic:
  1. I feel like a greedy algorithm is right...in
  2. We can sepperate into buckets...QB's, K's, and D's are always one to one,
  there is no sepcial logic for them
  3. WR's, TE's, RB's are trickier. My Gut says harvest the highest projected for their natarual positions
  and thent take the highest of the remaining players for the flex position
  4. In short of taking in matchups and the like...that's beyond me at the moment. ESPN's projections should do that already,
  But frankly I have to outsource to someone who knows football better. My other options are to create some advanced algorithm,
  or try to use some AI but GPT may be slightly behind on information, even if it can search the internet...IDK that's a later iteration.
  Or lastly I can try to use some advanced projections that someone else runs! I'm sure there is someone who does projections with a lower
  margin of error then ESPN, and if they are the kinda nerd who does that, they're the kinda nerd that probably has an API I can hit.
  chefs kiss. Also what if I do this in Java.
